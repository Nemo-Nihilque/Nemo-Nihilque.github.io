        <h1>About</h1>
        <h2>Backstory</h2>
        <p>
            Parking Lot Cleanup was originally founded by John Smith in 2007 as a way to help pay for college. Set up in Boise Idaho, 
            the had a rocky start, struggling to get it's first customer. After the first was found, it took a few years to really start 
            to build up a reputation and customer base. John's friend Anony Mous joined him at Parking Lot Cleanup to help expand the 
            potential customers and area. After some recommendations and suggestions, John also decided to look into power washing to 
            expand the services provided, and to better clean the lots serviced by PLC. While it's still a small company, there's plans
            to expand with more customers, and potentially even branching out to other cities!

                    was in need of funding to pay for his college classes, and decided to try and help fix a problem that always bothered him: 
                    trash filled parking lots. Married and proud father of two dogs, John is a diligent worker set on excellence.
